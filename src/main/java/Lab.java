     * A path parameter, in a URL, is a variable part of the URL that may be extracted. Typically, they identify

     * imaginary user profile feature on https://revature.com, where sending a GET request to
     * https://revature.com/user/1234 will display the information of user number 1234. The web API frameworks we'll
     * be using in the future will be able to do this for us automatically. For now, we will be using basic string
     * manipulation.
